##Summary

The temperatures between June and December do not show a huge difference with the exception of their lowest temperatures. It may be difficult for persons to surf and want to consume ice cream if the temperature is 56 degrees. We would also want to check the precipitation levels during these months to see how much the rain varies from the middle and the end of the year. Additionally, We could query  Fall and Spring temperatures to further compare variance throughout the year. Even if December is too cold, if Fall and Spring are warmer then it might show that most of the year is available.
